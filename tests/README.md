# Test the full UXD flow

Thanks to mocha `before`, it's split in files but they are ordered and a single test. Just split for readability.

Environment is setup, can add additional "flows" and add specific tests upon the existing.

This [cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/yoavniran/1e3b0162e1545055429e) is useful for Mocha/Chai testing.

Should investigate how to test for failure also, jet seems to have a fully fledged [Client](https://github.com/jet-lab/jet-v1/blob/e75fa9624468749ccaf03e2041ff2311b15f0645/libraries/ts/src/user.ts#L396) in TS?

Idk will pause here, bit lost now.
